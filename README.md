# Semesterproject N170 for Signal processing and Analysis of human brain potentials

The purpose of this repository is to share the code from the Semesterproject from Kay Roggenbuck for the lecture Signal processing and Analysis of human brain potentials.
I have chosen the N170 dataset.
The subjects 001, 017 and 031 were preprocessed by hand. 

## Important noted

The project is written in python 3.7 and the following libraries are used:

-osfclient 0.04

-mne 0.22.0

-mne_bids 0.5

-numpy 1.19.2

-scipy 1.5.2

To ensure reproducability for random decicions a random state is used. 
The different states can be found in the report.
